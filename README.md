# IPL Powerplay Score Prediction

This project aims to predict the score of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches during the powerplay overs using a neural network model.

## Overview

In this project, we use an IPL dataset that includes various features relevant to powerplay overs, such as batting team, bowling team, venue, and more. We employ a neural network model to predict the score a team is likely to achieve during the powerplay period.



## How to Use

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Prepare your IPL dataset, ensuring it includes features and powerplay scores.

3. Adjust the neural network architecture in the code to suit your needs.

4. Run the code to train the model.

5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Notes

- This project focuses on predicting scores during the powerplay overs of IPL matches.
- The provided code is a basic example and can be enhanced for better performance.
